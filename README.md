# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + Prettier Starter Template

This starter template is pre-configured with the following technologies to kickstart your Next.js project:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Prettier with a plugin for Tailwind CSS

This setup allows you to write React code in TypeScript, style your components using Tailwind CSS, and ensures your code is properly formatted with Prettier.

## Getting Started

### Follow these steps to create a new project based on this template:

### Step 1: Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blazeshomida/template_nextjs_tailwind_prettier.git
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies:

Navigate to your new project's directory, and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd template_nextjs_tailwind_prettier
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the development server:

Now you can start your development server and open your new project in the browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see your new project!

## Configuration

If you're using Visual Studio Code and the Prettier extension, you'll need to ensure that the "Require Config" option is enabled for the extension. This tells Prettier to always use the configuration file (.prettierrc) in your project, which includes settings for Tailwind CSS.

To enable "Require Config":

1. Open your Visual Studio Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or by pressing Ctrl+,).
2. Search for "Prettier: Require Config".
3. Check the box to enable it.

Now, Prettier will always use your project's configuration file, ensuring your Tailwind CSS is properly formatted.
